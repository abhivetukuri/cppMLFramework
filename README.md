# My Machine Learning Models Library

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models implemented in C++, including Perceptron, Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and K-Means Clustering. These models can be used for a variety of basic machine learning tasks, this library offers fast and memory efficient implementations in cpp. 

## Features

- **Perceptron**: A simple yet powerful linear binary classifier.
- **Linear Regression**: For predicting continuous values.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method used for classification and regression.
- **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised machine learning algorithm for data clustering.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

To use the library, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### Building the Library

Ensure you have a C++ compiler and make utility installed. Then, compile the library:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## API Documentation

The API for each model is intuitive and easy to use. Key methods include:

train(...): Used to train the model on a given dataset.
predict(...): Used to make predictions or, in the case of K-Means, to assign data points to clusters.
